# car Case App
### My first Spring Boot App:) It is my homework for Java Bootcamp that I am attending


### Description:

####1. Original scope as requested by training program:
   1. load predefined list of cars 
   2. display the full list of cars (endpoint: all-cars)
   3. display one randomly selected car (endpoint: car-for-today)
   4. find car by its licencePlate or part of the licencePlate (endpoint: search)
   5. each endpoint should be addressed via entering url in browser - no hyperlinks between endpoints required
####2. Additional scope as part of my self learing:
   1. each endpoint on separate html with hyperlinks to other endpoints
   2. main menu (endpoint:main)
   3. reading the list of cars from json on application start
   4. adding the new car to repository (endpoint:add-car) and saving the extended list of cars to json file
####3. Other remarks:
   1. after starting the application launch browser http://localhost:8080/main
   2. Tools used: Spring Web, controller, endpoint, annotations, Dependency Injection

####Feel free to comment !!!
