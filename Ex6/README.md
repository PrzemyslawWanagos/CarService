# Book Case App
### My first Spring Boot App:)

#### Tools used: Spring Web, controller, endpoint, annotations, Dependency Injection

### Goals:

1. Original scope as requested by training program:
   1. load predefined list of books 
   2. display the full list of books (endpoint: all-books)
   3. display one randomly selected book (endpoint: book-for-today)
   4. find book by its title or part of the title (endpoint: search)
   5. each endpoint should be addressed via entering url in browser - no links between endpoints required
2. Additional scope as part of my self learing:
   1. each endpoint on separate html with hyperlinks to other endpoints
   2. main menu (endpoint:main)
   3. reading the list of books from json on application start
   4. adding the new book to repository (endpoint:add-book) and saving the extended list of books to json file
3. Other remarks:
   1. after starting the application launch browser http://localhost:8080/main
